# Example 1


### Profile Generation from Seed Data

Here we have described a simulated persona of one Indian Female named Sita. 

Let us start system walk through from the time Sita registers into our ASA-HBC. Once registered, Sita is requested to provide access to any personalized self-written data. Sita provides access to Linkedin. Now, orchestrator generates message for behaviour assessment sub-system to use this data to generate profile information of Sita. Behaviour assessment sub-system extracts profile description from linkedin, and tasks LLM to extract structured profile information based on description. Figure shows query to LLM, output generated by LLM. This information is then stored in Users file in Datastore.

### Profile Generation Questionnare

Next, we can see that some profile information like name, age, gender are not generated. Also health and life style information is not generated. Thus , next orchestrator generates message for behaviour assessment subsystem to generate query for missing health profile information. Figure 4 shows query to LLMs and response questionnaire provided by LLMs.

### User Profile Data

Below is the profile information provided by user and was structured by LLM to store in Users in datastore.

### User Goal Options Creation

 Now, based on all the profile information in data store, LLMs are tasked to determine possible goals for user. Figure 5 shows query and output of LLM for this task.

### User  selected goal

User Selects below goal:

*Weight Management and Physical Activity: "Adopt a balanced diet and increase physical activity to manage BMI and enhance overall health."*

#### Answer of the questionnaire from user

*I am not very much concerned about impact of BMI on my health, yes I think stress eating is a problem, but i dont think it is going to affect me in near future. I believe what I eat affects my healh. Taking balenced diet will surely healp to my not just physical but mental health. I am not at high health risk based on current BMI. My current life style is not that bad, that it can affect my work or personal life. Balanced diet is more important than physical activity for improving my health. I think if I will take balanced diet, I will feel more fresh, light and energetic. I think I will become more fit and attractive that will affect my social life and because of energy, I will feel more enthusiastic to work. Biggest obstacle is my erratic work schedule, my tendency to get afraid in starting new thing and not being able to be consistent on achieving difficult goal. Also my love for variety of food will also be a problem. I do not drink very much alcohol, thus no issue. There is no garden near my house. there is a lot of pollution around me. I am not confident nor I have tried making lifestyle changes in past. Yes, film stars motivate me sometimes, but it is shortlived. the daily reminder partner and some reward might help me to stay motivated.*
