#### Answer of the questionnaire from user

*I am not very much concerned about impact of BMI on my health, yes I think stress eating is a problem, but i dont think it is going to affect me in near future. I believe what I eat affects my healh. Taking balenced diet will surely healp to my not just physical but mental health. I am not at high health risk based on current BMI. My current life style is not that bad, that it can affect my work or personal life. Balanced diet is more important than physical activity for improving my health. I think if I will take balanced diet, I will feel more fresh, light and energetic. I think I will become more fit and attractive that will affect my social life and because of energy, I will feel more enthusiastic to work. Biggest obstacle is my erratic work schedule, my tendency to get afraid in starting new thing and not being able to be consistent on achieving difficult goal. Also my love for variety of food will also be a problem. I do not drink very much alcohol, thus no issue. There is no garden near my house. there is a lot of pollution around me. I am not confident nor I have tried making lifestyle changes in past. Yes, film stars motivate me sometimes, but it is shortlived. the daily reminder partner and some reward might help me to stay motivated.*
